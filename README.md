This is a text based game created by my group and me during Techbridges 3.0. We created the base of the game with Twine and wrote all the text and added effects ourselves. 
The game starts players off with a general preface so they have an idea of what is going on. The player must then select a choice from the text highlighted in blue to advance the plot line. The playerâ€™s choices will dictate how the story plays out. At the end of the game, the narrative will either commit suicide or receive proper help for his or her mental illness. We created this game because the rate of teen suicides increases every year and will continue to do so unless a change is implemented. We hope this game will raise awareness about suicide and allow more people to feel comfortable when talking about mental health.
Through this project, I learned more about making games for a positive purpose and using them to tackle social issues. I also learned more about teamwork. Specifically, cooperating and coordinating tasks while also creating a viable product in a limited amount of time. This is also where I meet one of my close friends and a team member for future projects, Victoria Geh.
